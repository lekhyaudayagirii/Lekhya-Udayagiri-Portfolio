Airbnb Rental Price Prediction in Sydney

Project Overview
This project applies machine learning techniques to predict Airbnb rental prices in Sydney. By analyzing key factors such as property attributes, host details, location trends, and seasonal demand, it provides data-driven insights to optimize pricing strategies for Airbnb hosts and real estate investors.
This project was developed as part of QBUS6810 - Statistical Learning and Data Mining at the University of Sydney and was a collaborative effort by a team of students working together to apply data analytics and machine learning concepts in a real-world scenario.

Objective
Develop predictive models to estimate nightly rental prices.
Identify key variables that influence pricing strategies.
Provide data-driven insights for maximizing revenue and occupancy rates.

Dataset
This project utilizes Airbnb listing data, including:
Property Features: Bedrooms, bathrooms, amenities, and occupancy capacity.
Host Information: Superhost status, listing duration, and pricing history.
Location Data: Proximity to city center, transport links, and tourist attractions.
Market Trends: Seasonal fluctuations, competitive pricing analysis.
Guest Experience: Ratings, reviews, and customer engagement metrics.

Methodology
The project follows a structured machine learning pipeline:
Data Collection & Preprocessing – Handling missing values, removing outliers, and feature scaling.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Identifying key trends and correlations.
Feature Engineering – Constructing predictive variables to improve model accuracy.
Model Selection & Training – Implementing and comparing:
Ridge Regression
k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN)
Decision Trees & Random Forests
Gradient Boosting (XGBoost, Stacking Models)
Model Evaluation – Performance assessment using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R² score.
Insights & Recommendations – Generating pricing strategies based on model findings.

Key Findings
Higher guest capacity properties command higher rental prices.
Proximity to major landmarks and public transport significantly influences pricing.
Seasonal trends drive price fluctuations, with peak seasons offering higher revenue opportunities.
Positive reviews and high host ratings lead to increased demand and premium pricing.
Dynamic pricing strategies and flexible stay options enhance occupancy rates.

Technologies Used
Programming Language: Python
Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, Matplotlib, Seaborn
Machine Learning Techniques: Regression-based and tree-based models
Data Visualization: Price distribution plots, correlation heatmaps, and trend analysis
